          <p>Staten Island is the most isolated borough of all, which creates a unique quiet atmosphere that is not offered in any other borough. It is mostly suburban, and the kids I have met who were raised in Staten Island own their own cars and drive around (which is unheard of in Manhattan, almost as unheard of in other boroughs as well). Staten Island has a massive Russian and Italian population, which accounts for some of the best Russian and Italian food ever (featured in Insider!).</p>
          <p>Here are some of my favorite places to visit in this borough!</p>

                <h4>The Staten Island Ferry is the definition of cheap and easy transport. It is extremely easy to get to by train (at the South St. Seaport station on the 1 train) and is completely free with a transfer ($2 without)! There is a phenomenal view of the city skyline and Lady Liberty of course.</h4>

                <h4>I personally have never been to this museum, but I have heard nothing but good things about it! I would say it's definitely worth the visit via ferry. <a href="http://sichildrensmuseum.org/">Here</a> is where more info can be found.</h4>
