          <p>Fun fact: Queens is the biggest and most diverse borough in New York City. From Astoria to Forest Hills to Flushing, Queens has a large variety of things to do, eat, and participate in. There are culturally authentic places to eat on almost every block, and there are so many museums (e.g. Museum of Moving Image, NY Hall of Science, MoMA PS1) to visit. Don't forget citifield, along with Corona Park, where the U.S. Open takes place every year.</p>
          <p>Here are some of my favorite places to visit in this borough!</p>

                <h4>Probably on my top three favorite list of parks, Corona is a seemingly large and beautiful park with lots of memories for me. As a kid, I would come here every summer to watch the professionals compete in the US Open with my family. A link to the official park's site can be found <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/flushing-meadows-corona-park">here</a>.</h4>

                <h4>The one and only Queensborough Bridge! It is an interesting area to visit, and as always the view of the bridge offers a fantastic view of both Manhattan's and Queen's skyline.</h4>
