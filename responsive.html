          <p>Let me begin by asking: what is New York City without Manhattan?! If you like a busy atmosphere with constant noise and combustion on every corner, this is the place for you. In addition to the lively atmosphere, there is a very unique and distinctive cultural experience here. Everyone is of a different race, background, culture, etc. From Times Square to Central Park to Lincoln Center to the Whitney and PLENTY others, you will never run out of things to do here in this compact borough.</p>
          <p>Here are some of my favorite places that I've visited in this borough!</p>

                <h4>Next to Lincoln Center lies a beautiful grassy plain open to the public over the summer that is great for picnics. Sometimes, outdoor concerts are held there and you could watch the sun go down while listening to music. You can even see the stars! A link to the list of concerts can be found <a href="http://atrium.lincolncenter.org/index.php/free-performances">here</a>! </h4>

                <h4>A hidden gem on the Upper West Side of Central Park, "the Pool" is a scenic place to visit all year round. Some days, there will be a bright green moss blanket over the pool. Other times, it will be frozen, or perhaps surrounded by brightly colored trees.</h4>
